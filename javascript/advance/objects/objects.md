####  An object literal is a list of property key:values inside curly braces { }.

##   Note
#### But, there is no need to use new Object().
#### For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method.

## JavaScript Object.create()
#### The Object.create() method creates an object from an existing object.

## JavaScript Object fromEntries()
#### ES2019 added the Object method fromEntries() to JavaScript.
#### The fromEntries() method creates an object from iterable key / value pairs.


## JavaScript Object.assign()
#### The Object.assign() method copies properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

## In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

#### Objects are objects
#### Maths are objects
#### Functions are objects
#### Dates are objects
#### Arrays are objects
#### Maps are objects
#### Sets are objects

## JavaScript Primitives
#### A primitive data type is data type that can only store a single primitive value.
##### Immutable => Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

## JavaScript Objects are Mutable
#### Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
#### If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:

## Javascript Properties
#### An Object is an Unordered Collection of Properties
#### Properties are the most important part of JavaScript objects.
#### Properties can be changed, added, deleted, and some are read only.

## Property Default Values
#### A value given to a property will be a default value for all objects created by the constructor:


### ==========================================================

## Note:
#### The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.
#### After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.

## JavaScript Object Methods
#### Object methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
#### A method is a function definition stored as a property value.
