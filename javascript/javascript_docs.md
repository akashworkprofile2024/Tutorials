========  ARRAY =================
An Array is an object type designed for storing data collections.

Key characteristics of JavaScript arrays are:

Elements: An array is a list of values, known as elements.

Ordered: Array elements are ordered based on their index.

Zero indexed: The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

Dynamic size: Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.

Heterogeneous: Arrays can store elements of different data types (numbers, strings, objects and other arrays).

Arrays are Objects:
Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.
But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46};
Array Object be Like : person.firstName

Associative Arrays:
Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.

Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).

JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.

In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.  

The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

JavaScript has a built-in array constructor new Array().
